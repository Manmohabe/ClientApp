## Development server

Install the dependancies by running `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Angular 17.1.2 requires atleast node version ^18.13.0 . Check this [version compartibility](https://angular.io/guide/versions)

## Assumptions

This was a demonstration of Angular Key concepts implementation Such as Lazy loading, Basic Authentication, new Control flow,
Standalone Components, Angular Forms etc and therefore should not be used in production. 

The project uses [Material Components](https://material.angular.io/components/categories), [xng-breadcrumb](https://github.com/udayvunnam/xng-breadcrumb) and [ngx-layout](https://github.com/ngbracket/ngx-layout)

Default username and password is `admin`


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
